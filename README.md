# GOAL:

Iterate through all photos, find exif fields that are truly unique (which may or may not exist across all photos), get the names of those fields, combine that for primary_key - then with a dry run see if that presents any conflicts (eg. where there is still a duplicate detected despite combining unique fields together) - sound right?
